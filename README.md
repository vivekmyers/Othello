Plays Othello using a convolutional neural network heuristic function for minimax with alpha-beta pruning. Trains by simulating quick games with itself and using gradient descent to improve heristic board evaluations.

To run:
`python3 .`

To train:
`python3 neural.py [ITER]`

To clear model:
`python3 neural.py new`

To benchmark:
`python3 tester.py`
